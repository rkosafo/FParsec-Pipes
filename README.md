# FParsec-Pipes: making FParsec parsers even more concise and consistent

FParsec is an F# library for writing parsers. This library extends [FParsec][1]
with a new set of combinators, which I believe make it even easier to translate
from a formal grammar like [EBNF][2] to F# parsing code and end up with a fast,
highly readable parser.

The documentation is located at http://rspeele.github.io/FParsec-Pipes/Intro.html.
